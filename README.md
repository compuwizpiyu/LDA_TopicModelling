# LDA_TopicModelling
 Topic modelling pdfs with LDA
# Open the Topic_modeling_sector_V4.ipynb in Jupyter Notebooks/ Colabs 
# note that the initial code with Mapping files and sectors is our project environment settings. So if you need to test your own files 
# please modify this section:
# [os.path.join(r'C:\Users\<path to your folder containing PDFs>',x)for x in os.listdir(r'C:\Users\<path to folder containing you PDFs>')]
# you can ignore the mapping files and sectors section for your own tests/ LDA modelling purpose
